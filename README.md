Democratizing Biomolecular Interaction Modeling
</h1>

## Inference

You can run inference using Boltz-1 with:

```
boltz predict input_path
```

Boltz currently accepts three input formats:

1. Fasta file, for most use cases

2. A comprehensive YAML schema, for more complex use cases

3. A directory containing files of the above formats, for batched processing

To see all available options: `boltz predict --help` and for more informaton on these input formats, see our [prediction instructions](docs/prediction.md).

## Training

If you're interested in retraining the model, see our [training instructions](docs/training.md).

## License

Our model and code are released under MIT License, and can be freely used for both academic and commercial purposes.
